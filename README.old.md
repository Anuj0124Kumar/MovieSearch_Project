# moviesearch_project

Assignment Description:
Your task is to build a movie search application using React and the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API. The application should allow the user to search for movies by title and display the results in a list. The user should be able to click on a movie to view more details, such as the plot summary, rating, and poster image.


Task:
Set up a new React project using create-react-app.
Create a SearchBar component that allows the user to enter a movie title to search for.
Create a MovieList component that displays a list of movies returned from the OMDb API.
Create a MovieDetails component that displays more details about a selected movie.
Use the OMDb API to search for movies by title and display the results in the MovieList component.
Add functionality to the MovieList component to allow the user to select a movie and display its details in the MovieDetails component.
Style the application using CSS or a CSS library of your choice.
Deploy the application to a hosting service of your choice (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Heroku).
Submit your code and a brief report summarizing your findings.
Deliverables:
A GitHub repository containing the code and instructions for running the application.
A live demo of the application hosted on a hosting service of your choice.
A report summarizing your findings, including any challenges you faced, any libraries or frameworks you used, and any improvements you would make if you had more time.

Hints:
Use useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and side effects.
Use props to pass data and functions between components.
Use the fetch function or a library like axios to make HTTP requests to the OMDb API.
Use react-router to handle routing and navigation between different pages of the application.
Use GitHub Pages to deploy the application quickly and easily.
Consider implementing a loading indicator to provide feedback to the user while the search results are being fetched from the API.
